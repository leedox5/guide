There is nothing between us       but a contract.
There is nothing in      your way but you.
There is nothing here             but addresses and phone numbers.
There is nothing here             but friendship.

There is nothing we cand do        but wait.

There's  nothing left for us to do but kiss.

There is nothing on there related to anything but market trading.

How does it happen that 4 such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends ?
