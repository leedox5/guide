When are you planning to go?
Well, we don't know yet, because we just applied for our visas.
Our travle dates are still [[ up in the air ]], but

Oh, that's exciting!
My family and I want to take a trip to Europe by the end of the year but
it's difficult to coordinate our vacation dates between all of our jobs,
so everything is up in the air for us too!

B:
I hope you sort it out.
A family trip in Europe sounds amaziing!
