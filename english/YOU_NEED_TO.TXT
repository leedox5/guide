Maybe you need to try something new.

Tracking the ball:
You need to be able to visually track the incoming tennis ball,
judging its speed, direction, and spin.

Reacting quickly: 
Once you've tracked the ball, you 
need to react quickly with your hand movements to 
swing your racket and 
hit the ball at the right moment.

Hand-eye coordination for different strokes: 
Different tennis strokes require precise hand movements in coordination with 
where you're aiming to 
hit the ball. 
For example, a forehand swing requires a 
different hand-eye coordination than a 
backhand swing.
