To have something {down pat} is when 
you have information or a routine memorized perfectly.

I have my YouTube video creation process down pat.

We didn't have a lot of prep time.

When you rejig something, you change and improve the arrangement of something.
The arrangement is the order of something.

She spoils those kids rotten.

To spil someone (rotten) means to do what ever somone wants you to do or
 to give someone anything they want.

To be spoiled (rotten)
- To recieve whatever you want; to be treated very well.

Those sound more positive because it sounds like you're treated very well.
