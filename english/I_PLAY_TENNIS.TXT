A: How are you doing?
- turning the tables:
B: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!
   What about you, how are things going?
- Honest(if appropriate)
B: Haning in there, thanks for asking.
   A bit busy, but managing.
   

HANG IN THERE
Don't let your misfortune bring you down.
Don't get too depressed studying English.
= Keep your chin up.
= Keep at it.

Just hang in there, Okay? I'll figure something out.

If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen in this world.

Listn up!
  I am not going to take   this lying down.
= I'm  not going to accept this.
If someone takes an insult or attack lying down, they accept it whithout protesting.



KEEP AT
- to continue to do or work on something
I kept at it and finally finished at three this morning.


A: I'm looking forward to getting to work with you today.
B: I'm looking forward to it! 
   Let's collaborate and make today productive and successful.
B: Appreciative:
   Thanks! I'm looking forward to learning from you today as well.

GET TO
to be given permission or the opportunity to do something
especially that which is desirable and out of the ordinary

A: How was the seminar?
B1: I        met  many people there.
B2: I got to meet many people there.

I          got to meet him, and I was real excited.
We finally get to meet your boyfriend!
We finally get to meet Vera.

I hope to get to travel more often.
I hope to get to spend  more time back here at Google.

Why does he get to choose? It's my turn.

I don't get to see     my Harriet as much as I used to.
Everything is expensive nowadays, so
I don't  get to eat out            as much as I used to.
I don't  get to work with him      as much as I used to. 

I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

===================

Did you get a chance to read the insight?

It's been eight years since I took up tennis. 
As you know, it's hard to become good at any sport, especially tennis. 
So while I'm far from being a professional, I've improved my game over the past several years. 
And the fact that it's difficult is one of the reason that I like playing.
