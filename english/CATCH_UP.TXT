It's been so long!
We should grab coffee sometime and catch up.

A: Hey, it's been ages since we caught up.
   How about we hang out this Saturday?

B: Absolutely! We could go out to that new cafe downtown.

A: Sounds good! We can grab a bite there and chat about
   what's been happening.   

B: Perfect! See you this Saturday.
