Could you please []?
Could you please [write it down]?
Could you please [repeat that]?
Could you please [speak more slowly]?
Could you please [say it in a different way]?

When I read it, it's easier than listening to it.
A lot of English speakers speak too fast.

It's perfectly okay if you say politely:
They keep saying the same thing the exact same way, and
 that's no helpful.

Sometimes I really need to hear it in different words.

Double check what the person is telling you.

This pretty much means that 
 after you've told them you don't understand and
 you've asked them to use some sort of strategy,
 the third thing is you're going to make sure you really understood.

So, how are you going to do this?
Well, one thing you can do is 
 you can repeat back what the person said to you.

So what you're saying is [    ].
So what you mean is [    ].
I think I get what you're saying [    ].

Instead of not having any clue what is happening and 
very confused all the time, at least you're going to be
more confident, and you will understand more.

These strategies will help you understand a lot more than
 if you just look scared, and nod and say: "I understand" when you don't.
