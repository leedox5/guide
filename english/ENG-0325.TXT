    That 
difficulty is an oppor...
tunity to get st...
ronger, to de...
velop 
character,  to
gain new
confidence.

   That
pain is 
not there to
stop you, it's
there to pre...
pare you, to in...
crease you, to de...
velop you.

Just because it
hasn't 
happended 
yet,
doesn't 
mean that it's
not going to
happen.

    There will
always be
forces 
trying to
convice us to
settle where we
are.

    It's 
easy to 
settle from medi...
ocrity.

어떤 단어를 설명할 수 있는 더 쉬운 단어가 분명히 있을 것이다.
There must be an easier word to describe something.

Turn it a...
round and re...
member your 
dream.

    Have you a...
llowed any
dreams to get
buried in
you?

    At
one time, you be...
lieved you could
do something 
great,
    you be...
lieved you could
lead the 
company in
sales,
    you be...
lieved you could
break that a...
ddiction.

   The
enemy would
love to de...
ceive you into
burying your
dream.

    It's 
not too
late to be...
come 
all that you were 
created to
be.

    You're re...
moving some 
dirt.

    You're 
digging it back
out.

    The
true 
mark of a
champion 
    is
even though some
dirt get's
thrown on your
dream,
instead of 
letting it get
buried, you
keep
shaking it
off.

    You
wouldn't have 
so many things
coming against 
you.

You may have
tried a
year ago,
5 years ago or
40 years ago.

Nodoby was there to
help you?

    Your
destiny is
calling out to
you.

Constantly 
struggling, 
barely 
getting by, 
    is
not the
end of your
story.

    The ad...
versity is 
temporary.

    The 
glory is e...
ternal.

This is my
year to go
further in my ca...
reer
   to
step into a 
new 
level of my
destiny.

This is my
year to a...
ccomplish
dreams.

Now 
get your
mind
going in the
right di...
rection.
