Do you have any plans this weekend ?

Here's a little technique that you can do.

Remind me, where are you from again?
Remind me, where did you go on vacation last year again?
Remind me, what was your last company again?

You can get that conversation started.

There's someone new who's arriving at your office.

Approach them and simply say, I don't think we've met yet.
The more you do it, the easier it becomes 
the more comfortable you'll feel doing it
the better you'll do it.

Skills need to be maintained.

Becoming fluent in English is a goal for a lot of people.
