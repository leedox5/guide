When the suglight strikes raindrops in the air,
they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
These take the shape of a long round arch, with ites path high above,
ant ites two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
