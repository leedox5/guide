English does not pay attention to the number of words or
even the length of words-it's all about the number of BEATS
(SYLLABLES-both STRESSED and UNSTRESSED)!




Linking Same Consonants:
If it's a stop, (but not ch or j)
hold the stop at the end of the 1st word
and release it on the 2nd word.

 Keep peace
  tab bar
  hot tamale
 he'd decided
 bake cakes
  big game
  
Let's make hot tamales for the big game.
             ---                 ---
             
tamale   a Mexican food


In English, STRESS is contrastive, which means that 
in order for the STRESSED SYLLABLE to sound LOUDER, LONGER and CLEARER,
often the other SYLLABLES will need to be UNSTRESSED, or REDUCED, in sound.

This also works at the SENTENCE LEVEL.
STRESSED WORDS will sound LODER, LONGER and CLEARER than UNSTRESSED WORDS.
