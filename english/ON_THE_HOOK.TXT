Scenario 1: Obligation

Two friends, Sarah and Michael, are discussing a party they're both planning.

Michael: (Sighs) Ugh, no, I completely forgot!

Sarah  : Don't worry about it, I can do it. 
         You've already been taking care of a lot of the other arrangements.

it's his responsibility and he has to deal with it.
