Can you SORT OUT these files alphabetically?

I've sorted these out based on their importance.
I've sorted       out the best options.

It's hard to SORT    OUT the truth from the lies,
It's hard to SORT    OUT the facts.

             SORTING OUT the truth is the only thing that I do.

I've been planning to sort out my files but
I haven't got around to it yet.

I know it's a mess, but we'll sort it         out.
                  We're gonna sort this mess  out.
       Okay, no problem. I'll sort it         out. I'll call you back.
                  It's almost sorted          out.
           Don't worry. It'll sort itself     out.
               I'm sure it'll sort itself     out.
         I'll talk to her and sort everything out.
